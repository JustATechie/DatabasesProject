Changes to original questions:
None.

New questions:
Added section for interacting with Food Assistance data because it was really cool. We did not count this in our total query count.

Some stuff we couldn't do:
We wanted to have the Add Data portion of our project to be much more streamlined in terms of user experience.
However, it was extremely difficult to try to implement a cascading dropdown selection system for location information
for the tables. We did not like this approach, but aftr tinkering for a few hours trying to get it to work,
and several google searches later, we realized it would not be possible without lots of javascript (which Louie
does not know).

Changes to our data:
While testing, we noticed that some of our queries did not work with our small files (which we found odd,
considering we tested and made sure we got correct output when we wrote them). Due to this, we had to make a few
additions from our larger full data to our small data. Notably, some California heart disease data, california
child obesity data,
