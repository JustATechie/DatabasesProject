HOW TO SET EVERYTHING UP:
clone our repo directly into your ugrad home.

cd into DatabasesProject

log into dbase, select your database and run:
source ~/DatabasesProject/sql/production/setup/cleanup.sql
and:
source ~/DatabasesProject/sql/production/setup/setup.sql;

You can now exit out of dbase!

cd into your home dir

copy our public_html file into yours with:
cp DatabasesProject/public_html/* public_html/DatabasesProject/

some helpful commands for ugrad:
(they require you to be in the right sub folder already)
(dont forget to make DatabasesProject executeable as well!)

Make all subfolders executable:
find public_html/ -type d -exec chmod o+x {} \;

make all files in assets readable:
find assets/ -type f -exec chmod o+r {} \;

copy .htaccess to all sub directories with the same persmisisons
for dir in `find . -type d` ; do cp -p .htaccess $dir/.htaccess ; done
