SETUP GIT-LFS RIGHT NOW. https://git-lfs.github.com/

THEN CLONE THE REPO. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY CLONED THE REPO, YOU NEED TO RECLONE!

WHEN YOU ADD A LARGE FILE (GREATER THAN 10 MB) YOU NEED TO ENTER INTO THE FOLDER THAT CONTAINS THAT FILE
AND RUN: git-lfs track *.zip *.csv *.xls *.xlsx

YOU CAN THEN COMMIT AND PUSH (MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT THE gitattributes FILE SO THE LARGE FILE CAN COMMIT
(I USUALLY ONLY COMMIT THE gitattributes AND THEN MAKE A SECOND COMMIT WITH THE LARGE FILE.)

I've finished the data for the following table completely: FoodLegislation. US cities and Datatypes is also done.
I've laid out some directions for the table that were too big to be edited in excel beyond pruning.

After the full data is done, we need to figure out what data we want to use from each as small data.
