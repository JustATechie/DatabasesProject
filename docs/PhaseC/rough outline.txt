A potential mapping of data files to schemas:

Organization:
Data Genre
    File Name
    Table name and columns

File organization:
if Excel file:
    Name of file: Name of tab in file


------Begin Outline------

Location:
    US Cities.csv
    Location: LocationID (increment), state, county, city, locationType.

Note: You will need to add a column for locationID. Since data is organized by city, please add row
entries of just state names and also state names and their counties. This way we cover all the bases if
location is specified down to state, down to county, or down to city. No need to remove any columns.
Because we were given an excel file I was able to just delete them very easily. I also took the liberty
and added all 50 states on their own at the end of the file.


When we later look up data, if we need just the ID where no county or city is specified, we can select where
state=name and County=null. Then we will get the ID of just the state entry.
