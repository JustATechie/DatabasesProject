In the "ready" folder in data, you will find data files that are ready to be processed by scripts for
final additions.

Directions for each genre:
Disease by county - Federal#.csv:
    These two files have final data for heart disease and are ready to have locationID's assigned to them.
    In each, there are two columns specifying that row's State and county. Use this to search through the
    US Cities.csv file for the appropriate locationID.


I removed some tables I felt could be combined, and others that seemed impossible to get as explained in
process.txt. If you disagree, the tables are still present in setup.sql, they are just commented out.

We stil need data for avghousehold table. Could you please find this? It shouldnt be too hard, but if its taking a while
I can definitely do it.

First, I would say move the current implementation over to the dbase account and try running as-is. You'll need to change the file
paths but other than that, everything should work. you'll get some warnings about data type being wrong and not enough data for
some rows and thats fine. it'll add what we currently have.

Let me know if you have any issues.
